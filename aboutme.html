         <h1>My Story</h1>
        <h3> My PAO </h3>
      <p> My story begins when I was 16 and found out that I had <strong>elhers danlos syndrome</strong> a connective tissue disorder. 
        I was and still am a dancer and after finding out about my elhers danlos I began examining my pain more and 
        trying to become more in tune with my body. I had been experiencing hip pain in my right hip for almost two years 
        and while I tried to blame it on being out of shape. I was dancing 12-14 hours a week and still found it difficult 
        to walk for more than an hour. During my Senior dance performance I experienced a sharp pain in my hip 
        and although I wanted to ignore it my mother had already noticed and decided that it was time to take action.</p>
      <p>
        I had a series of <strong>X-rays and MRI </strong> which ultimately led me to <strong>Vanderbilt Childrens Hospital</strong> where I met <strong>Dr. Schoenecker. </strong>
        He explained that my pain was due to <strong>hip dysplasia</strong> likely developed while I was in puberty. My hip socket 
        was far too shallow and that was why I could not sit comfortably, raise my leg above a certain height and why my <strong>labrum</strong> hurt so much. 
        Additionally my labrum was torn and the only way to fix the pain was to relieve the pressure from my hip socket. </p>
      <p>
        It was decided that I would have a <strong>periacetabular osteotomy</strong>, a surgery where they cut the hip bone break it apart, reshape it so 
        that the socket covers the <strong>femoral head</strong> before securing it in place with a few <strong>headless screws.</strong>
        As I was in college in Virginia and I am originally from Tennessee I had to leave  the semester early to drive home and have surgery over the holiday.
        While the surgery was successful the recovery process wasn't easy, I often found myself feeling very frustrated and alone. 
        While I joined many groups online most of its memebers where much older than me and
        had a very different recovery process/experience from my own. 
      </p><p> I suffered from a major set back with my <strong>lateral femoral cutaneous nerve</strong> being so aggravated that I was forced
      to go into the ER to get a <strong>nerve block</strong> only 1 week after my initial surgery. 
                I struggled to recover after going back to Virginia as I did not have access 
      to a <strong>Physical Therapist</strong> near my college so I had to stay determined and do PT on my own. In the present day I am fully recovered and very happy that I did the surgery 
        but the process to get to this point wasn't easy.  My goal with this website is to provide a community for young adults like myself. 
      A place where they can connect and discuss without the advice or assumptions of older people who have a much different recovery process. </p>

        <h3>My FO</h3>
      <p> This was my second surgery and I had already been through the worst part. For my left side I a much worse case <strong>femoral anteversion </strong> meaning 
            over time as a way to compensate for my shallow hip socket my femur rotated which gave me more outward rotation and less inward rotation. ("More Anterversion and Less Retroversion")
        For this surgery my doctor determined that he would not need to perform another PAO instead 
        I would need a <strong>femoral osteotomy.</strong></p>
      <p> The surgeon would go in through my knee insert a <strong>metal rod</strong>, he would attach two handles
        at the top and bottom of the femur and rotate the femur. The goal was to angle the femur so that the shallow socket would completely cover the <strong>femoral head. </strong>
        This would ensure that I got the correct range-of-motion, from there the surgeon instertd 4 headless screws and then closed me up. 
        The good news was that for this surgery I was immediately able to put weight on my leg so I could begin walking via, crutches as soon as I could handle the pain. </p>
      <p>
        Being able to get up on day 1 made a huge difference, this combined with my previous experience from my PAO made my second surgery a much easier recovery.
        That is not to say it was perfect 
        I stil had set backs, I had issues with scar tissue build-up in my knee and as of writing this I am facing some setbacks due to <strong>impingement </strong>of the hip joint.  
        I am still in recovery from this surgery as my femur slowly heals back to normal but overall this was a much easier surgery. 
      </p><p> This time I found that there was even less support online as most people who have a <strong>femoral osteotomy</strong> have a slightly different procedure than I did. 
        So there was even less support than with my PAO and even fewer young people who had this surgery. Additonally I had a very uncommon case
      in which I had two different <strong>hip preservation surgeries.</strong> A <strong>periacetabular osteotomy</strong> on the right hip and a <strong> Femoral Derotational Osteotomy </strong> on the left hip. 
      Unfortunately there isn't much information about this kind of case 
      and often when I try to look up my own symptoms I don't find results. Its frustrating to be a young adult with <strong>hip dysplasia</strong> especially one who is in college. 
        That is why I believe that it is necessary to have a place where young adults can find information beyond what is provided for older adults and children. </p>

        <h1> What is a Femoral Osteotomy? </h1>
      <h3> How Normal Hips Function &amp; Hip Anatomy</h3>
        <p>To help better understand deformities of the hip, it's helpful to understand
            the <strong>normal hip</strong>.
            The "ball and socket" joint is located where the thigh bone (femur) meets the pelvic bone (pelvis).
          The femur is the largest bone in the body and provides the essential joint 
            connection to the body, as well as support of body weight and alignment of the
            leg. The upper segment of the femur, also called the femoral neck, curves 
          and angles forward toward the pelvis. </p>
          <p> At the top of the femur 
            is the <strong>femoral head</strong> that fits inside the cavity found in the pelvis 
          that forms the ball-joint socket, also known as the <strong>acetabulum</strong>; 
            which all together forms the hip joint. The surfaces of the joint are
            covered with a smooth, cushioning layer called <strong>articular cartilage</strong>. The articular cartilage is what absorbs your weight 
            and allows the bones to glide smoothly back and forth as you walk. A health hip will show a perfect fit between the head
          of the femur and the hip socket secured in place by the acetabulum.
          <br> <strong>(Figure 1)</strong></p> 
      <h5> The Importance of the Femur Angle </h5>
      <p>
            The angle of the femoral neck to the shaft of the femur is
            called <strong>version</strong>. This can be considered to be the "twist" or 
            "torsion" of the femur bone. Normal version is a forward angle
        of about 12 to 15 degrees.
      In individuals with version  deformities, the femoral neck may be rotated either too far
            forward - a condition called <strong>excessive anteversion</strong> as shown in <strong>(Figure 2)</strong>, 
        or too far backward, which is a condition called <strong>retroversion</strong>. <strong>(Figure 3)</strong> 
      Both of these conditions result in the ball portion of the hip joint being situated at an
            unhealthy angle to the cup portion of the socket. Which can lead to 
      damage to the hip joint surfaces and surrounding structures.</p>
      <p>
            In some cases, patients with hip deformities will need arthroscopic 
            procedures, which is a minimally invasive surgery; in which the surgeon uses a 
            miniaturized camera and instruments to address issues such as loose or 
            damaged tissue or to remove bone ridges that are causing impingement. 
            If the femoral neck-shaft angle is too steep (<strong>coxa valga</strong>) or too flat (<strong>coxa vara</strong>),
            it can be corrected by applying a plate or inserting a rod into the upper femur after cutting 
            the bone. Often, the rotation (version) of the femur is abnormal as well 
            and this is corrected at the same time. <br>

        <h1> What Does a Femoral Osteotomy Procedure Look Like?</h1>
        <h3> Traditional Correction: Plates &amp; Screws </h3>
        <p> This procedure requires an incision
          long enough to apply the plate onto the <strong>femur</strong>. During the procedure,
          the orthopedic surgeon cuts the femur and corrects the <strong> angle (version) </strong>
            of the bone. Once the desired position is achieved, the surgeon places a <strong>metal fixation
          (pins, plates or rods) </strong> in the bone to stabilize the osteotomy  site during bone healing. <br>
          <strong>(Figure 4)</strong> </p>
      <h3> Rotational Correction: Rod &amp; Nail</h3>
      <p> Although a <strong>femoral osteotomy </strong> can be significant surgery, it is possible to perform
            it in a minimally invasive manner. Meaning the surgeon is able to spare the
            muscles and other important structures surrounding the hip. If the  femoral neck-shaft angle
            is normal, and the deformity is purely rotational, the operation will be less invasive. 
        This is because a <strong> metal plate </strong> is not screwed into the femur, and the incision can be much smaller. 
        The incision will only be long enough for the surgeon to insert a rod through the <strong>upper portion of the hip </strong>and into the <strong>femur. </strong>
             The same incision is used to cut the femur from the inside without exposing the <strong>osteotomy</strong> site.
          This means that the muscles do not have to be lifted away from the upper portion of the femur.<br>
             <strong>(Figure 5)</strong> </p>

         and the <strong>intramedullary saw </strong> is inserted.
         <br><strong>Figure 5 (right):</strong> Prior to
         performing the osteotomy, <strong>Steinmann Pins (medical rods/screws) </strong> are placed for rotational
             control in the desired amount of correction.</p>

              <strong>intramedullary nail</strong> to maintain the correction while the bone heals.</p>

        <h1> Step By Step </h1>
        <h4>🚶‍♀️ Pre-Surgery: The Decision and Preparation</h4>
        <p>The Diagnosis and Consultation <br>
            The Problem: "For a long time, I've had issues with how my
            leg or foot turns—maybe it's severe in-toeing or an alignment
            problem causing me pain. I feel like I'm tripping more often 
            or the pain is limiting my life."<br>
            The Consultation: "My doctor confirmed that the issue 
            is in my femur (thigh bone) and it's rotated too much. 
            They explained that an osteotomy—cutting and repositioning the 
            bone—is the best way to fix it. We looked at X-rays and scans 
            that clearly showed the twist." 
            Preparing for the Day: "I met with the surgeon, 
            anesthesiologist, and nurses. They told me exactly what
            to expect, from what to wear to when to stop eating and 
            drinking. It all feels very real now."
            <br>
            The Day Before
            Final Instructions: "I'm checking off all the final 
            instructions: no food or drink after midnight, packing 
            a loose, comfortable outfit for when I go home, and getting
            my mind ready. I feel a mixture of nervousness and excitement 
            for the change."
      </p>
      </div>  <!-- surg1 class -->
       <div id="surg2" class="col-md-6"> 
        <h4>🏥 Day of Surgery: In the Hospital</h4>
        Arrival and Pre-Op
        Checking In: "I arrive at the hospital and get checked in.
        I'm wearing a gown and lying in a bed. A nurse takes my vitals, 
        asks me a lot of questions (What surgery? Which leg?), and starts 
        an IV in my arm."
        Meeting the Team: "The surgeon comes by to say hello and 
        draws markings on my leg—like a final confirmation of which side
        and where the cut will be. The anesthesiologist explains how
        they'll put me to sleep (general anesthesia) and manage my pain,
        possibly with a nerve block to keep the leg numb for a while after
        the operation.<br>
        Moving to the OR: "The nurses wheel me on the gurney into a
        bright, cool operating room. I see all the machinery and monitors.
        The last thing I remember is breathing into a mask or the feeling 
        of the anesthesia starting to work in my IV..."<br>
        The Surgery (Patient is Asleep)
        The Procedure: (The patient is completely asleep and feels 
        nothing during this time. The surgical steps include an incision, 
        cutting the femur, rotating the lower part of the bone to the correct
        alignment, and then fixing it with a metal plate and screws.)<br>
        Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU)
        Waking Up: "I slowly wake up, feeling a little groggy and 
        disoriented. My leg feels heavy and stiff, but thanks to the 
        nerve block and initial pain medication, the pain is usually dull 
        or manageable, not sharp. I notice a large bandage on the outside 
        of my thigh."
        Monitoring: "Nurses are constantly checking on me—my blood pressure,
        oxygen, and most importantly, the feeling and circulation in my foot
        and toes. I'm asked to wiggle my toes to make sure everything is
        working."

    <div id="surg3" class="col-md-6"> 
        <h4>🛌 Post-Op and Recovery: Days 1-5 in the Hospital</h4>
            Managing Pain and Starting Mobility
        Pain Control: "The nerve block eventually wears off, and the
        pain becomes more noticeable. The nurses manage it with oral and IV
        medications to keep it under control. The goal is to get ahead of
        the pain so I can start moving."
        The First Stand/Walk: "This is the big one. A physical therapist
        (PT) comes in, and with their help and the use of crutches or a 
        walker, I attempt to sit up and put a little weight on my operated 
        leg—or sometimes no weight atall, depending on the surgeon’s orders.
        It's awkward, exhausting, and maybe a little scary, but the PT is 
        there to guide me."<br>
        Education and Discharge
        Learning the Rules: "The physical and occupational therapists 
        teach me all the rules: how much weight I can put on the leg (often
        non-weight-bearing for weeks), how to safely use crutches, how to get in
        and out of bed, and how to bathe.<br>
        Home Prep: "Before they let me leave, I must prove I can safely 
        manage my pain, get out of bed, and get around with my mobility 
        device. They also go over wound care instructions for my incision."
        Going Home: "Finally, I'm cleared for discharge. I'm usually wearing
        some kind of brace or splint, and I need help getting into the car. 
        The biggest challenge has begun: recovery at home."

        <h4>🏡 Home Recovery and Long-Term Healing</h4>
        Weeks 1-6: Non-Weight Bearing Phase
        Crutch Life: "My life revolves around my crutches.
        Everything takes longer and requires more planning. 
        I'm on pain medication for a few days to a week, then mostly 
        switching to over-the-counter pain relievers. I focus on resting,
        keeping the incision clean, and doing the simple exercises the PT 
        gave me."
        Follow-up: "I go back to the surgeon for my first check-up.
        They check the wound and take X-rays to see how the bone is starting
        to heal around the plate and screws." <br>
        Weeks 6-12: Physical Therapy and Weight Bearing
        Clearance to Load: "At a check-up, the X-rays show enough healing
        that the surgeon clears me to start putting some weight on my leg.
        This is a huge milestone!"
        Intensive PT: "I start formal physical therapy. It's tough! 
        We work on gently bending and straightening the leg, strengthening
        all the muscles that were cut or stretched, and retraining my brain
        to walk with my newly aligned leg. My gait feels strange because my 
        foot is pointing straight now."<br>
        Months 3-6 and Beyond 
        Returning to Life: "I'm off crutches and walking without assistance.
        My leg is still stiff and I'm still doing PT, but I feel stronger 
        every week. The focus shifts to getting back to normal 
        activities—walking longer distances, going up stairs easily, and 
        eventually returning to sports or work. I can feel the difference
        in my alignment; the reason I had the surgery is gone."

        <h1>What is Periacetabular Osteotmy? </h1>
      <p>  During a <strong>periacetabular osteotomy</strong>, the surgeon makes a series
        of cuts to the bone in order to reposition the <strong>acetabulum (hip socket)</strong> in the pelvis,
        to restore/create a more normal hip joint anatomy.</p>
        <p> <strong> Metal Screws </strong>are then placed into the bones to help stabilize the hip in this new position.
        During the healing process, new bone will form to cover up the cut 
            surfaces and secure the <strong>repositioned acetabulum </strong> in the pelvis.
            This helps to estbalish proper alignment of the ball and socket joint.

        <h1> Surgery Recovery </h1>
        <p>Patients typically begin <strong>physical therapy (PT) </strong> the day after surgery, to begin working on <strong>range-of-motion.</strong>
            PT will work on walking, first with a walker and then with crutches. 
            Patients who have stairs at home will work on going up and down
            the stairs before leaving the hospital.            </p>
        <p>After a PAO, patients are discharged with a <strong>home exercise program. </strong>
            Over the next several <strong>weeks and months</strong>, patients gradually regain strength and mobility. 
            <strong>Crutches</strong> are very important for the first several weeks after a PAO while 
            the bone is still healing. Most patients use crutches for <strong>two months post-surgery.</strong>
            After the hip has healed, most people are able to return to their highest level of activity.
            Many people return to competitive sports after a PAO, although the time varies from 6 months to 1 year.<br>

        <h1> The Outlook After Surgery</h1> <!--NOTE! these sections and their information may change later on -->
        <p>There is a positive outlook for people undergoing PAO surgery,
            while it can vary based on a number of factors that majority of people see major improvement. 
            Factors can include, age, degree of <strong>osetoaethritis</strong> before surgery and <strong> hip joint congruncey (how well the femoral head 
            fits into the socket). </strong>  </p>
        <p>
            After the procedure and rehab program, people can 
            return to normal activities, including sports &amp; hobbies. 
            Studies have shown that in the long term, this procedure helps 
            <strong>preserve the health of the hip joint </strong>by preventing or delaying 
            the development of <strong>osteoarthritis.</strong>
            While outcomes of a PAO are typically excellent, 
            some people still develop osteoarthritis and may eventually 
            need to undergo a <strong>total hip replacement surgery</strong>  in the future.<br>

        <h4>📅 Before the Surgery (Pre-operative Phase)</h4>
        <p>
            <strong>Consultation and Diagnosis:</strong> You've likely met with your orthopedic surgeon,
            had imaging (X-rays, CT, MRI), and discussed why PAO is the best option for
            your hip dysplasia.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Pre-Surgical Testing and Clearance:</strong> You'll need a history and physical
            exam from your primary care doctor. Blood work,
            and sometimes a specialized MRI (like a dGEMRIC) to assess the cartilage.
            Clearance letters from any specialists you see (e.g., cardiologist).
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Medication Adjustments:</strong> You will be instructed to stop certain medications
            for a set time (often 1-2 weeks before surgery), including:
            Anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs like Ibuprofen, Naproxen) 
            Aspirin or blood thinners.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Home Preparation:</strong> This is crucial for your recovery.
            Gather necessary equipment: Crutches (you will use these
            for 6-8 weeks or more), possibly a walker, shower chair, 
            raised toilet seat, and a leg lifter. 
            "Nesting": Prepare a recovery station (often on the first floor)
            with everything you need within easy reach. Remove tripping hazards
            like rugs and cords.
            Arrange for a caregiver (friend or family) to help you 
            for at least the first two weeks post-discharge. 
        </p>
    </div>
       
    <div id="surg2" class="col-md-6"> 
        <h4>🏥 The Day of Surgery</h4>
        <p>
            <strong>Check-In:</strong> Arrive at the hospital, usually very early in the morning. 
            You'll sign in and receive an ID bracelet.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Pre-operative Area:</strong> Nurses will check your vitals, review your medication list, 
            and confirm when you last ate or drank (you must be NPO—nothing 
            by mouth—after midnight). An IV (intravenous line) will be started,
            and you may receive pre-operative medication to help you relax.
            The surgeon and anesthesiologist will meet with you to 
            review the plan and answer any final questions.
            The surgical team performs a Time Out procedure and
            the surgeon marks the correct hip for surgery.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>The Operating Room (OR):</strong> You will be moved to the OR 
            and given general anesthesia. The procedure itself can be 
            complex and last 4 to 9 hours. During the surgery, the hip socket
            (acetabulum) is cut from the pelvis, repositioned for better 
            coverage of the ball, and secured with screws.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU):</strong> You wake up here. 
            Your leg will feel heavy and you will likely have significant pain. 
            Nurses will monitor your vital signs, manage your 
            initial pain with medication (often through an epidural 
            or IV pump), and observe the surgical site.
        </p>
 
      </div>
      
   
    <div id="surg3" class="col-md-6"> 
        <h4>🛌 Hospital Stay (Post-operative Phase)</h4> 
        <p>The typical stay is 3 to 4 days. The goal is pain control,
            mobility, and discharge planning.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Day 0 (Surgery Day):</strong> You remain in the PACU or move
            to your hospital room. Pain management is the priority.
            You may have a urinary catheter, a surgical drain, 
            and blood flow devices (like compression stockings
            or sleeves) on your feet/legs.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Day 1 and 2:</strong> Drains and the catheter are often removed.
            You transition from strong IV/epidural pain medication to 
            oral medication (pills).
            Physical Therapy (PT) begins immediately! A 
            therapist will help you get out of bed for the first time, 
            sit in a chair, and start simple exercises. You will practice
            walking with your crutches, learning your strict weight-bearing
            restrictions (usually toe-touch or partial weight-bearing only).
            The physical and occupational therapists teach you how to 
            safely get dressed, bathe, and navigate stairs with your
            crutches.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Discharge:</strong> You are ready to go home once your
            pain is managed with oral medication, you can safely walk
            with crutches on your own, and you can handle stairs (if needed)
            or safely manage your living situation.
        </p>
    </div>
       
    <div id="surg4" class="col-md-6"> 
        <h4>🏡 At Home (Recovery)</h4>
        <p>This is a long but critical period of healing and strengthening.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Weeks 1-2: Rest and Managing Discomfort</strong><br>
            Pain: The first two weeks are often the most difficult
            in terms of pain and stiffness. Take your pain medication
            as directed.
            Mobility: You will be mostly homebound. 
            You must use your crutches at all times and strictly
            follow the weight-bearing limits.
            Wound Care: Follow instructions for dressing changes; sometimes dissolvable
            sutures are covered with a clear seal or Steri-Strips that 
            fall off on their own. 
            PT: You will continue with home exercises prescribed by your therapist.
            Logistics: Rely heavily on your caregiver for meals,
            chores, and getting things you need.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Weeks 3-8: Healing and Increased Activity</strong><br>
            Follow-up Appointment:
            You will have your first check-up with the surgeon, 
            often including new X-rays.
            Weaning off Crutches: Generally, at 6 to 8 weeks, if the X-rays show good bone healing, 
            your surgeon or physical therapist will clear you to gradually 
            increase your weight-bearing. This means transitioning from 
            crutches to one crutch or a cane, and eventually walking unassisted.
            Physical Therapy: Outpatient physical therapy begins, 
            focusing on increasing your range of motion, flexibility,
            and strengthening the muscles around the hip.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Months 3-12+: Full Recovery</strong><br>
            Return to Life: Most patients can 
            return to school or a desk job around 4 to 6 weeks, but may not 
            drive until they are off narcotics and fully weight-bearing 
            (usually 6-8 weeks).
            Return to Sports: High-impact or demanding activities like running or sports are usually
            cleared at 6 to 12 months, based on your hip's strength 
            and stability.
            The Long Haul: Physical therapy and home exercises are a long-term commitment. 
            Full recovery—meaning maximal strength and the final outcome of
            the surgery—can take up to a year or more.
